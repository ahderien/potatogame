    <div class="front"><h1>What is Potato Game?</h1>
    <p>Potato Game is a game which is being coded completely using HTML, CSS, AngularJS and JSON.</p>
    <p>It's a simple choose your own adventure game with an adorable cast of pixel characters.  Coded and drawn by yours truly.</p>
    
    <h1>Why this?</h1>
    <p>For fun.  Yup.  This is fun for me.  I'm one of those sterotypical millenials who started using technology at a young age, and when I was 8, I discovered HTML, then CSS about 9 years later.  In 2015 I started to dabble in JavaScript, and although I know all sorts of fun languages now like React, Node, and Socket.io, Potato Game is kind of darling baby and problem child.</p>
    
    <h1>Is it done yet?</h1>
    <p>Nope.</p>
    
    <h1>How about now?</h1>
    <p>Don't make me turn this video game around.</p>
