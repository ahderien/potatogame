    <div class="front"><h1>What is Potato Game?</h1>
    <p>Potato Game is a game which was coded completely using HTML and CSS (and possibly jquery.  We're not there yet).</p>
    <p>It's a simple choose your own adventure game with an adorable cast of pixel characters.  Coded and drawn by yours truly.</p>
    
    <h1>Why this?</h1>
    <p>For fun.  Yup.  This is fun for me.  I'm one of those sterotypical millenials who started using technology at a young age, and when I was 8, I discovered HTML, then CSS about 9 years later.  Code and I are thick as thieves.</p>
    
    <h1>Is it done yet?</h1>
    <p>Nope.</p>
    
    <h1>How about now?</h1>
    <p>Don't make me turn this video game around.</p>
